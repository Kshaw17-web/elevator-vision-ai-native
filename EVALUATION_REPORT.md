## 1. Detection (YOLOv8n Button Detector)

Evaluation on the held-out **test split** (113 images, 761 ground-truth annotations, confidence threshold >= 0.45).

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Precision | **0.9882** |
| Recall | **0.9931** |
| mAP@50 | **0.9915** |
| mAP@50-95 | **0.7359** |

**Validation metrics at best epoch (epoch 21):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Precision | 0.9863 |
| Recall | 0.9923 |
| mAP@50 | 0.9941 |
| mAP@50-95 | 0.7241 |

**YOLO-only inference latency** (measured — `models/best.pt`, 113 test images, CPU, imgsz=512, conf=0.45):

| Stage | Per-image (ms) |
|---|---|
| Preprocess | 2.36 ms |
| **Neural-network inference** | **72.8 ms** |
| Postprocess | 1.29 ms |
| **Total YOLO pipeline** | **76.45 ms** |

| Throughput | Value |
|---|---|
| Inference-only FPS | **13.7 FPS** |
| Full YOLO pipeline FPS | **13.1 FPS** |

> These figures cover **YOLO detection only** (no EasyOCR). Measured via `results[0].speed` from the
> Ultralytics API on a warm model (one warm-up image excluded). EasyOCR recognition adds approximately
> 0.5–1.5 s per button crop on the same hardware, making OCR the dominant latency in the full pipeline.
> Full training curves and per-epoch metrics are in `runs/detect/button_yolov8n_fast_baseline/results.csv`.

## 2. OCR (Button Text Recognition)

Evaluation on all 113 test-set images, matching YOLO detections to ground-truth labels.
Source: `runs/detect/button_yolov8n_fast_baseline/ocr_evaluation/ocr_results.csv` (761 rows).

> Note: Results are from the V1 OCR evaluation script (`scripts/ocr_evaluation.py`), which used CLAHE + Otsu
> preprocessing. The production pipeline (`src/ocr.py`) uses a 4-pass EasyOCR approach with grayscale +
> digit/B allowlist. 

### Counts

## 3. End-to-End (Floor Identification)

A full-test-set end-to-end run was not completed due to CPU time constraints (EasyOCR across 761 crops).
The available result is the 5-image qualitative demo using the final production pipeline.
Source: `runs/detect/button_yolov8n_fast_baseline/final_demo/final_demo_results.csv`

| Image | Target | Found | Predicted | Match |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6_mp4-0016...jpg | 11 | No | 7 | FAIL |
| 12_mp4-0021...jpg | 20 | Yes | 20 | PASS |
| 12_mp4-0020...jpg | 19 | Yes | 19 | PASS |
| 3_mp4-0009...jpg | B1 | No | 7 | FAIL |
| 18_mp4-0038...jpg | 7 | Yes | 7 | PASS |

| End-to-end metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total test cases (qualitative demo) | 5 |
| Correct floor identifications | **3** |
| End-to-end accuracy | **60% (3 / 5)** |

**Failure analysis:**
- target=11, predicted=7 — multi-digit button misread; OCR returned 7 instead of 11
- target=B1, predicted=7 — B1 glyph on reflective surface read as 7

> The 5-image demo is qualitative only. See Section 3b below for the quantitative evaluation.

## 3b. Quantitative End-to-End Evaluation (Production Pipeline)

A deterministic 20-image subset of the 113-image held-out test set was evaluated using the actual
production pipeline (`detect_floor.py` + `src/`). Images were selected with `random.sample(seed=42)`
on the sorted test image list. Three of the 20 images contained only icon buttons (Open/Close/Emergency)
with no floor labels in `dataset_button/original_labels/` and were excluded, yielding **17 valid test cases**.

For each image, the most frequent floor label in the ground-truth metadata was used as the target floor.
The target was supplied to `detect_floor.py --target-floor` and the pipeline result was compared against it.
The ground truth did not influence the prediction — it was only used to select the target argument and
judge correctness after the pipeline returned.

| 4_mp4-0008…jpg | 7 | 15 | ❌ |
| 6_mp4-0008…jpg | 8 | 2 | ❌ |

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Images sampled (seed=42) | 20 |
| Valid test cases (floor labels present) | **17** |
| Skipped (icon-only panels) | 3 |
| **Correct floor identifications** | **10** |
| **Incorrect floor identifications** | **7** |
| **End-to-end accuracy** | **10 / 17 = 58.8%** |

**Failure analysis:**
- B1/B2/B3 failures dominate: 3 of the 7 failures had target=B1, consistent with the 18.18% B1 OCR accuracy.
- Single-digit mismatches (7→6, 8→17, 7→15, 8→2): OCR returned a different valid floor label that scored higher.

> **Scope note:** This is a deterministic 20-image sample from the 113-image held-out test set.
> It is NOT a full-test-set end-to-end evaluation. Results are indicative of production pipeline
> performance on my hardware (CPU, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U).

## 4. Summary

| Stage | Key metric | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Button Detection | mAP@50 (test set, 113 images) | **99.15%** |
| Button Detection | Precision / Recall | 98.82% / 99.31% |
| OCR | Floor-label accuracy | **66.62% (459 / 689)** |
| OCR | Multi-digit accuracy | 83.55% |
| OCR | B1/B2/B3 accuracy | 18.18% |
| End-to-end | Demo accuracy (5 images) | 60% (3 / 5) |
| End-to-end | **Quantitative (20-image sample, 17 valid)** | **58.8% (10 / 17)** |

The detector performs at near-production quality. OCR is the primary bottleneck, especially for single-digit
floors and basement labels. Replacing or augmenting EasyOCR with a domain-fine-tuned scene-text model
would be the highest-impact improvement.
